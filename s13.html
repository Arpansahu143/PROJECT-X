                                <p class="card-text"><small class="text-muted">By Maria Luisa Lang</small></p>
                                <p class="card-text">Now a New Yorker, the Pharaoh’s cat--the ancient Egyptian feline
                                    with human powers--travels back in time to free Egypt’s legendary Queen Nefertiti
                                    from a horrific curse, discovering firsthand why her mummy has never been found and
                                    her famous bust is missing one eye.

                                    As in the first Pharaoh’s cat novel, the cat is quick-witted, wisecracking narrator
                                    as well as free-spirited, ever-curious protagonist, and the story he tells is an
                                    exotic, imaginative, spell-binding tragicomedy. The Eye of Nefertiti also
                                    interweaves feline and human, past and present, natural and supernatural. It too
                                    contains numerous surprises, twists and turns, intriguing characters, both human and
                                    animal, fascinating revelations about ancient Egyptian history and culture. Added to
                                    all this is an ingenious use of the Tarot and Italian opera.

                                    The cat is living happily in New York City with the High Priest, Elena, daughter of
                                    an Egyptologist, and their infant son, the cat’s beloved Pharaoh reincarnated, when
                                    the supernatural gradually intrudes in the form of phantasms, the plot of an Italian
                                    opera, a Tarot card reading, and an unexpected summons to present-day Bath Spa
                                    disguised as an opportunity for Elena.

                                    She and the little Pharaoh travel conventionally while the cat and the High Priest
                                    take the little boat they use for time travel and are diverted to ancient Stonehenge
                                    for a brief stop-over. The figure at the center of their encounter with the Druids
                                    has been prefigured in the cat’s phantasms, the Italian opera, and the Tarot
                                    reading, all his uncanny experiences being in accord with a single design.

                                    Reunited with Elena and the infant Pharaoh in Bath, the cat and the High Priest
                                    discover a secret tomb below the Georgian house where they are staying, and are soon
                                    impelled to journey to ancient Egypt in the time of Queen Nefertiti to save her from
                                    a horrific curse. They become separated as they search for Nefertiti and the cat has
                                    several adventures before finding her on his own.

                                    He undertakes an ingenious deception to stay close to her without revealing his
                                    identity. Being so close, he falls in love with her. He succeeds in lifting the
                                    horrific curse at great cost to himself. Despite his love, he surrenders Nefertiti
                                    to history and, mourning his loss, descends into a psychological abyss so deep only
                                    the Pharaoh can save him.

                                    Maria Luisa Lang was born in Rome and lives in New York City. She has an art degree
                                    and is an amateur Egyptologist. The Pharaoh's Cat is her first novel, The Eye of
                                    Nefertiti her second.</p>
